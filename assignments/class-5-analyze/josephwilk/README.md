# Books shared illegally on PirateBay

__Goal__: To explore the sensitivity of Machine learning and its misuse when looking at models trained on different languages.

Scrapped Source data is a 1000 of the most popularly ebook titles that are shared illegally on PirateBay (https://thepiratebay.org).

Iâ€™m partially interested in the fragility and mis-use of machine learning. We are purposely using data that the models have not been trained on and comparing what this means in terms of output.

## Nouns through many language models

Turning book titles into nouns and then feeding that back into the next language model. So the output is nouns processed by every single language model:

__Effectively which words are recognised as nouns in all the language models.__

Sorted by frequency.


```python
   ['Duryodhanization', 'Delusion', 'Version', 'Presidents', 'Burning', 'Religion', 'Cryptocurrency']
```

## Book Similarity across Corpus

For each, based on titles finding the most similar books for each language training model.

__Effectively which book title has most in common with all the other book titles in different languages.__
